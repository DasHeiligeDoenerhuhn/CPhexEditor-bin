Simple hex-editor for the classpad 2 for hollyhock

This is based on the template https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork/tree/master/app_template 
for the hollyhock launcher by The6P4C or the fork by Stellaris-code: 
https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork

The hollyhock launcher is under the GNU license, so I think this should be te same license (because it is based on the template).
