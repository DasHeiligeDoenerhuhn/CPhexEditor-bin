Simple hex-editor for the classpad 2 for hollyhock

This is based on the template https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork/tree/master/app_template 
for the hollyhock launcher by The6P4C or the fork by Stellaris-code: 
https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork

The hollyhock launcher is under the GNU license, so I think this should be te same license (because it is based on the template).


Usage: 
- Use cursor keys to move the cursor
- type in the command line and type goto to jump to a place
- type in the command line and type write to modify the current cursor location (byte, word or long)
- type in the command line and type read to read the content of the current cursor position as a byte, word or long. The content typed is not important, only the amount of characters selects if a byte, a word or a long is read.
- type in the command line and type a search arrow to search in that direction. Touching the screen while searching makes the search faster, because I was lazy while programming...
- use the keys "=" "x" "y" "z" "^" "%" as the digits A to F
- no warranty for anything.
